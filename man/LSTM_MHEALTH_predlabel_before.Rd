\title{The precomputed prediction labels from LSTM for MHEALTH before oversampling.}
\format{A list of prediction labels.}
\usage{
data(LSTM_MHEALTH_predlabel_before)
}
\details{
The LSTM for large dataset is slow. To avoid running LSTM every time creating 
the vignettes, the precomputed result is recorded for vignettes knit efficiency.
