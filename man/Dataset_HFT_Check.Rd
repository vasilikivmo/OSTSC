\title{The high frequency trading data.}
\format{A dataset with 3000 observations and 10 sequence length, with a single sequence per row. 
\describe{
  The y data is the class label (1, -1 or 0)
  The x data constructs time series sequences (in numeric)
  ...
}}
\usage{
data(Dataset_HFT_Check)
}
\description{
The data is a random selection from a high frequency trading data.
}
\details{
The feature is from instantaneous liquidity imbalance using the best bid to ask ratio, up-tick 
as class 1, down-tick as class -1, and normal status as class 0. The time series sequences length is set 
to 10. In this package, the class 1 and class -1 observations are random selected till 60, while the 
class 0 is 2880. While the whole observations are ordered in the time order, the dataset haven't split 
training and setting data. The users can split it by any ratio they like.
