#' @title The precomputed prediction labels from LSTM for MHEALTH after oversampling.
#'
#' @details The LSTM for large dataset is slow. To avoid running LSTM every time creating 
#' the vignettes, the precomputed result is recorded for vignettes knit efficiency.
#'
#' @format A list of prediction labels.
